# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This repository is the Ansible playbook and roles for the **Épicerie Le Détour**'s infrastructure (a self-managed grocery store). It configures VPS/self-hosted Debian servers and services: multi-store Borg backups, Google Drive proxies, Wordpress, Grafana, Mattermost, and two custom Le Détour applications (member status checking, food voucher scanning). See `README.md` for the full rationale and core values (infra-as-code, self-hosted OSS, Google auth, Wireguard-only network access, HTTPS everywhere).

## Environment & commands

Use `uv` to run everything (Ansible, ansible-lint, molecule) — dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`. Do not `pip install` ansible tools globally.

```sh
# Local dev/testing with libvirt VMs (safe — never touches production)
uv run molecule create        # create the VMs (pi1, srv1, vps2, b72) defined in molecule/default/molecule.yml
uv run molecule prepare       # prepare VMs for the playbook
uv run molecule converge      # run playbook.yml against the VMs
uv run molecule verify        # check that wordpress, vouchers, membres, grafana and mattermost work
uv run molecule converge -- --tags vouchers --tags borgmatic_create   # run with extra tags
uv run molecule login --host vps2
uv run molecule destroy

# Linting (ansible-lint also checks YAML formatting)
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # once per clone: lint staged files + syntax check before each commit
uv run ansible-lint                   # whole repository, ~25 s
uv run ansible-lint --fix             # fix what it can, then review the diff

# Production (real servers, defined in inventory/hosts.yml)
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --limit charles-ws --tags workstations_networkd   # configure a workstation Wireguard connection (never runs by default, tag is "never")
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --limit charles-lp --tags workstations_nm         # same, through NetworkManager
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags <role>         # run one role/tag, e.g. --tags wordpress

# Vault
./vault_password.sh                 # decrypts the vault password (used internally by ansible.cfg's vault_password_file)
ansible-vault encrypt --vault-id @prompt secret.yml
ansible-vault view secret.yml
ansible-vault decrypt secret.yml
```

`bin/open-charles-workstation-firewall-for-molecule.sh` temporarily opens Charles's workstation firewall for the VMs.

There is no unit test suite; **Molecule is the test harness**. It boots libvirt VMs from Debian 13 (trixie) cloud images and converges the real playbook against them via `molecule/default/converge.yml`, which sets `deployment_is_dev: true` before importing the root `playbook.yml`. `molecule/default/verify.yml` (run by `molecule verify`) checks the web services after a converge; add a `molecule/default/verify/<service>.yml` for each new web app.

Molecule inventory is linked directly to `inventory/groups.yml` (see `molecule/default/molecule.yml`), so VM hostnames (`pi1`, `srv1`, `vps2`, `b72`) must match group membership there. Molecule uses its own vault_password_file pointing at the same `vault_password.sh`, so vault-encrypted vars work identically in dev and prod.

### Testing web services after converge

All web services are additionally exposed as `https://<service>.localhost` on the webserver host itself. `molecule verify` relies on this: its `uri` tasks run on the VM, so no tunnel is needed. Each `verify/<service>.yml` records its failure instead of stopping, so one run lists every broken service.

To investigate by hand, tunnel port 443 from the VM:

```sh
ssh -N -L 443:localhost:443 -i ~/.ansible/tmp/molecule.*/id_ssh_rsa molecule@<vm-ip>
curl -kL https://wordpress.localhost
curl -kL https://vouchers.localhost
curl -skL https://membres.localhost/members.json | jq   # add --cert/--key roles/membres/files/client.crt|key for non-anonymized data
```

## Architecture

### Playbook structure (`playbook.yml`)

A sequence of plays, each scoped to an inventory group, applying roles tagged for selective runs:

1. **workstations_networkd** / **workstations_nm** (tag `never`, `workstation`) — `workstations_networkd` / `workstations_nm` roles configure the workstation's Wireguard connection to the `vps2` endpoint through systemd-networkd or NetworkManager; explicitly opt-in only, run with `--limit <workstation>` on the workstation itself (the `workstations` parent group in `inventory/hosts.yml` sets `ansible_connection: local`, never ssh).
2. **servers** — `authorized_keys`, `sshd` (tag `ssh`).
3. **servers** — `common_packages`, `hostname`, `timezone`, `upgrade`, `ufw`, `fail2ban`, `wireguard`, `srv` (tag `common`). Sets `group_suffix: "-server"`.
4. **backup_destinations** — `borg_storage`, `borg_destination` (tag `backup`, `destination`).
5. **backup_sources** — `systemd_handlers`, `borgmatic`, `borgmatic_system` (tag `backup`, `source`).
6. **dataproxies** — `systemd_handlers`, `gdrivesync` (tag `dataproxies`): Google Drive sync on `pi1`, at 01:00, before the 04:00 backups.
7. **grafana** — `systemd_handlers`, `grafana` (tag `grafana`): grafana, loki and prometheus on `srv1`, reachable over Wireguard only.
8. **webservers** — `systemd_handlers`, `caddy_handlers`, `caddy`, `vouchers`, `membres`, `wordpress`, `grafana_proxy` (tag `webservers`).
9. **mattermost** — `caddy_handlers`, `caddy`, `mattermost` (tag `mattermost`): Bâtiment 7's chat.batiment7.org on `b72`, Team Edition with PostgreSQL. `/usr/local/sbin/mattermost-import` on the host loads another server's data (database dump, `config.json`, attachments), migrating it through the ESR versions in `mattermost_import_steps`.
10. **servers** — `node_exporter`, `alloy`: monitoring agents.

Roles run in dependency order within each play; e.g. `caddy` must run before the site roles that register Caddy vsites and `notify: caddy changed`.

### Key cross-cutting patterns

- **`deployment_is_dev` / `deployment_is_prod` / `deployment_suffix`**: defined in `group_vars/all/vars.yml` (`deployment_is_dev` is `false` unless Molecule's `converge.yml` sets it, the other two derive from it). Roles branch on these to install dev-only Caddy internal CA certs, etc. When adding new roles that behave differently in Molecule vs. production, follow this pattern rather than inventing a new flag.
- **`group_suffix`**: set per-play (`"-server"`) and used by the `wireguard` role to `include_tasks: "wireguard{{ group_suffix }}.yml"`, selecting a host-class-specific task file. Same technique to reuse for any role that needs materially different behavior per host class.
- **Handler pattern**: config-writing roles (`caddy`, `vouchers`, `membres`, etc.) `notify` shared handlers defined in small dedicated `*_handlers` roles (`caddy_handlers`, `systemd_handlers`) rather than each role owning its own handler — this lets multiple roles safely reload the same service (e.g. `caddy changed` → `systemd: name: caddy, state: reloaded`) without duplicate handler definitions.
- **Backup topology (Borg/borgmatic)**: `borg_destination` role provisions a `borg` user + repo storage on hosts in `backup_destinations`; `borgmatic`+`borgmatic_system` on `backup_sources` hosts creates SSH trust to every destination (`roles/borgmatic/tasks/destination.yml`, looped via `groups['backup_destinations']`, using `delegate_to`) and templates per-source borgmatic config. `borgmatic_snippet` is a reusable sub-role (`include_role`) that other backup roles (e.g. `borgmatic_system`) call with `borgmatic_snippet_name`/`borgmatic_snippet_file` passed as the `include_role`'s `vars`, to add another backup "set" (a systemd unit + optional service data dir) without duplicating the borgmatic config/repo-init/create/restore logic. `create`/`restore` are gated on `ansible_run_tags` containing `borgmatic_create`/`borgmatic_restore` (opt-in via `--tags`, not run by default).
- **Caddy vsites**: each web app role (wordpress, vouchers, membres) templates its own `/etc/caddy/sites.d/<app>.caddy` file (Caddyfile with `import sites.d/*.caddy`-style layout, implied) rather than one central vhost file — keep this per-role-owns-its-vsite convention for new web apps.
- **Inventory** (`inventory/hosts.yml` + `inventory/groups.yml`): `hosts.yml` maps inventory names to `ansible_host`/`ansible_user` (bootstrap connection info); `groups.yml` assigns hosts to functional groups (`servers`, `backup_destinations`, `backup_sources`, `webservers`, `vouchers`, `grafana`, `mattermost`, `dataproxies`) and, in `hosts.yml`, `workstations_networkd`/`workstations_nm` that the playbook's plays target. A host can belong to multiple groups (e.g. `vps2` is a server, a backup source, and a webserver).
- **Vault-encrypted values** live inline in `group_vars`/`host_vars`/role `vars` files as `!vault |` blocks (see `roles/wordpress/vars/main.yml`), decrypted via `ansible.cfg`'s `vault_password_file=vault_password.sh`, which in turn calls `age -d` using the SSH private key matching the encrypter's public key in `keys/`.

### First-time production bootstrap

New production machines start with only SSH + passwordless sudo for a `debian` user; the very first `ansible-playbook` run must be pointed at the LAN IP explicitly (`-e "ansible_host=<ip> ansible_user=debian"`) because Wireguard (used for all subsequent connections) doesn't exist yet — see README "First setup of a production machine" for the full sequence. Expect a reboot for full-disk-encryption unlock on first run.

## Language convention

Le Détour's convention is private French, public English: internal documentation is in French. This repository, its code, and its comments are in English since it's public. Don't translate one into the other.
